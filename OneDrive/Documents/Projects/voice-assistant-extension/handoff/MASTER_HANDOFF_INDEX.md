# Master Handoff Index - Voice Assistant Browser Automation

This file tracks all development sessions for continuity between Claude sessions.

## Active Development

**Current Phase**: Phase 5 - Browser Automation Complete, Voice Recognition Blocked
**Last Session**: 2025-10-28 16:52 EDT (Full Pipeline Implementation)
**Next Priority**: Fix voice recognition (replace Web Speech API with offline STT like Vosk)

**Status Summary**:
- ✅ Desktop app with mic access working
- ✅ Chrome extension loaded and connected
- ✅ Native messaging bridge functioning
- ✅ **Full command pipeline tested and working** (button click confirmed)
- ❌ Voice recognition blocked by network errors (Web Speech API issue)

## Session History

### 2025-10-28 16:52:40 EDT - Full Architecture Implementation ✅
**Status**: ✅ Core functionality complete, voice recognition needs fix
**Phases Completed**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (partial), 5

**Summary**:
Built complete hybrid voice-controlled browser automation system from scratch. Electron desktop app captures microphone, communicates with Chrome extension via native messaging bridge, successfully clicks elements on web pages. Full command pipeline tested and working with manual button. Only blocker: Web Speech API has network errors in Electron environment.

**Major Accomplishments**:
- Created Electron app with microphone access and audio visualization
- Built Chrome Manifest V3 extension with native messaging support
- Implemented native messaging host with Chrome's stdio protocol
- Registered native messaging in Windows registry
- Achieved full end-to-end command flow: Electron → Native Host → Chrome → DOM Click ✅
- User confirmed: "it clicked the search button. success?"

**Key Decisions**:
- **Framework**: Electron (vs Tauri) - better voice library ecosystem, user has powerful PC
- **Architecture**: Hybrid with file-based IPC between Electron and native host
- **Development**: Incremental with testing after each phase (avoided massive build-then-test)
- **Workaround**: Manual test button to validate pipeline while fixing voice recognition

**Files Created** (15 total):
- Desktop app: package.json, main.js, index.html, renderer.js, native-host.js, native-host.bat, com.voiceassistant.host.json, register-native-host.bat
- Chrome extension: manifest.json, background.js, content.js, popup.html, popup.js, icon.png
- Documentation: Updated CODEBASE_INDEX.md with full file catalog

**System Changes**:
- Windows Registry: Registered native messaging host
- Chrome Extension: Loaded unpacked (ID: lbcnhpobdoecbgaackpmkkhbidjefmpp)

**Known Issues**:
1. **Speech recognition network errors** (BLOCKING voice input):
   - Web Speech API requires Google servers, failing in Electron
   - Manual button works as workaround
   - **Solution**: Replace with offline STT library (Vosk or Whisper.cpp)
2. Content script timing (RESOLVED): Added error handling

**Testing Confirmed**:
- Microphone capture: ✅ (visual numbers 0-100)
- Extension loading: ✅ (content script on all pages)
- Native messaging: ✅ (error disappeared after registry setup)
- Command routing: ✅ (all 3 consoles show clean message flow)
- DOM manipulation: ✅ (clicked search button on Engadget.com)

**Next Steps** (Priority Order):
1. **Replace Web Speech API** with offline STT (Vosk recommended):
   - `npm install vosk` in /app
   - Download English model (~50MB)
   - Update renderer.js to use Vosk instead of Web Speech API
2. **Test voice → click pipeline** end-to-end
3. **Implement natural language element matching** (Fuse.js for "click on Mary Sue")
4. **Add text-to-speech feedback** (chrome.tts API)
5. **Build macro system** for common responses

## Notes for Future Sessions

**Development Philosophy**:
- Build slowly, test frequently ✅ (Followed this session)
- Maximum 1-2 files per phase before testing ✅ (Followed this session)
- User confirmation required before proceeding ✅ (User validated each phase)
- Never build 50 files before first test ✅ (15 files total, tested incrementally)

**Testing Checkpoints**:
- Phase 1: Mic captures audio ✅ PASSED
- Phase 2: Extension loads in Chrome ✅ PASSED
- Phase 3: App and extension communicate ✅ PASSED
- Phase 4: Single voice command works ⚠️ BLOCKED (network error)
- Phase 5: Voice command clicks element ✅ PASSED (via manual button)
- Phase 6: Full feature set works ⏳ PENDING

**What Worked This Session**:
- Incremental testing caught issues immediately
- User feedback loop prevented wasted work
- Manual workaround allowed progress despite voice blocker
- Detailed logging across 3 contexts (Electron, extension, webpage) enabled fast debugging

**Commands to Resume**:
```powershell
# Start desktop app
cd "C:\Users\haith\OneDrive\Documents\Projects\voice-assistant-extension\app"
npm start

# Reload extension
chrome://extensions/ → Click refresh

# Check logs
# - Electron: DevTools (opens automatically)
# - Extension: chrome://extensions/ → "service worker"
# - Webpage: F12 → Console
```

**Project Location**:
- Windows: `C:\Users\haith\OneDrive\Documents\Projects\voice-assistant-extension`
- WSL: `/mnt/c/Users/haith/OneDrive/Documents/Projects/voice-assistant-extension`
- **Note**: Must run from Windows for native messaging to work
