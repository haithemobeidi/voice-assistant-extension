# Work Session Reminder

You are actively working on **EmuSave**.

## Code Quality Standards
- ✅ **TypeScript strict mode** - No `any` types without justification
- ✅ **Comments for handoffs** - Explain complex logic for future Claude sessions
- ✅ **Consistent formatting** - Use project's ESLint/Prettier config
- ✅ **Test before committing** - Verify features work end-to-end
- ✅ **Library-first approach** - Use existing packages, don't reinvent

## Documentation Standards
- ✅ Update relevant markdown files when adding/changing features
- ✅ Keep `plan/outline.md` current with phase progress
- ✅ Document architectural decisions in appropriate plan files
- ✅ Add comments explaining "why" not just "what"

## Communication Standards
- ✅ Update TodoWrite frequently - mark completed immediately
- ✅ Use AskUserQuestion when requirements are unclear
- ✅ Provide clear status updates as work progresses
- ✅ Be honest about limitations or uncertainties

## Agent Coordination
- Consult specialized agents for complex, multi-domain tasks
- Use Architecture Specialist for system design decisions
- Use Network/API Specialist for sync protocol design
- Use Security Expert for authentication/authorization features
- Use Android Specialist for mobile app development

## Quality Checklist (Before Marking Tasks Complete)
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Server/app runs without errors
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Feature tested manually (user tried it)
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Network scenarios tested (LAN/remote if applicable)

Continue working with these standards in mind.
