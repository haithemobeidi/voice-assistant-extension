# Work Session Reminder

You are actively working on **Pokémon Tool Kit (Poke-Kit)**.

## Code Quality Standards
- ✅ **TypeScript strict mode** - No `any` types without justification
- ✅ **Comments for handoffs** - Explain complex logic for future Claude sessions
- ✅ **Consistent formatting** - Use project's ESLint/Prettier config
- ✅ **Test before committing** - Verify features work end-to-end
- ✅ **Library-first approach** - Use existing packages, don't reinvent

## Documentation Standards
- ✅ Update relevant markdown files when adding/changing features
- ✅ Keep `plan/outline.md` current with phase progress
- ✅ Document architectural decisions in appropriate plan files
- ✅ Add comments explaining "why" not just "what"

## Communication Standards
- ✅ Update TodoWrite frequently - mark completed immediately
- ✅ Use AskUserQuestion when requirements are unclear
- ✅ Provide clear status updates as work progresses
- ✅ Be honest about limitations or uncertainties

## Agent Coordination
- Consult specialized agents for complex, multi-domain tasks
- Use Architecture Specialist for system design decisions
- Use UI Components Specialist for responsive design work
- Use Security Expert for authentication/authorization features

## Quality Checklist (Before Marking Tasks Complete)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Dev server runs without errors (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Feature tested manually (user tried it)
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Responsive design works (mobile + desktop)

Continue working with these standards in mind.
